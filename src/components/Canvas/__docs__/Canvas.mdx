# Canvas

Component designed to generate a captcha image with customizable properties such as text, background color, and dimensions.

This component doesn't offer any kind of validation. It doesn't regenrate captcha automatically. It's just a visual representation of the given text. However, this component gives you a full flexibility and doesn't force to use any UI library.

> **Note:** This component is crucial for enhancing security by providing a captcha challenge to user interactions.

#### Example

<Canvas of={CanvasStories.Default} />

## Usage

**Example.tsx**:

```tsx
import { Canvas } from "react-my-captcha";

const Example = () => {
    return (
        <Canvas
            captchaText="V2LOKcB" //this must be a random text
            backgroundColor="#ffffff"
            width={200}
            height={50}
            minPoints={10}
            maxPoints={20}
            minLines={3}
            maxLines={5}
            fontFamilies={["Arial", "Verdana", "Courier New", "Georgia"]}
            minFontSize={20}
            maxFontSize={30}
        />
    );
};

export default Example;
```

> **Note:** Customize the `Canvas` component properties as needed to fit the design and security requirements of your application.

## Custom styling

The `Canvas` component uses a CSS class named `captcha-canvas` for the `<canvas>` element. You can personalize the appearance of the captcha canvas by defining custom styles for this class in your CSS or SCSS files.

For example, to add a border, you could write:

```css
.captcha-canvas {
    border: 2px solid #000;
}
```

# Arguments

<ArgTypes of={CanvasStories.Default} />
